Description:

The "Library Project using Dart" is a software application developed to manage a library's book inventory and facilitate user interactions through a Command Line Interface (CLI). The project is implemented in the Dart programming language, providing a user-friendly and efficient experience for both library staff and patrons.

**Key Features:**
1. **Querying Books:** Users can easily search for books in the library by title, author, or any other relevant criteria. The CLI interface allows for quick and straightforward searches.

2. **View Available Copies:** The application provides information about the number of available copies for each book, helping users know whether a specific book is currently in stock.

3. **Adding and Deleting Books:** Library staff can seamlessly add new books to the library inventory through the CLI interface. Similarly, they can remove books from the inventory when they are no longer available.

4. **Book Purchase and Invoice:** Patrons can purchase books from the library, and the application will automatically reduce the number of available copies. After each purchase, the system generates a detailed invoice showing the purchased books and the total cost.

**Project Structure:**
The project adheres to a well-organized structure, making it easy to navigate and maintain. It includes separate modules for different functionalities, such as book management, purchasing, and invoicing.

**Technological Aspects:**
The application utilizes core programming concepts like classes, abstraction, and functions to enhance the code's modularity and reusability. Dart's powerful features are leveraged to ensure an efficient and scalable solution.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
The project will be evaluated based on its ability to fulfill the specified requirements, its coding quality, organization, and maintainability. Additionally, the extent of test coverage for the application's features will be a crucial factor in the evaluation process.

**Timeframe and Delivery:**
The project is expected to be completed within a timeframe of 3 days. The final version will be delivered through GitHub, ensuring a seamless and accessible method for reviewing and evaluating the project.

In conclusion, the "Library Project using Dart" aims to provide an intuitive and functional system for managing a library's book inventory. With its user-friendly CLI interface and well-implemented functionalities, the project is designed to efficiently serve both library staff and patrons.


## Library Project using Dart

### Requirements:
- The project should be written in Dart language.
- The project should have a CLI (Command Line Interface) that allows users to query books, view the number of available copies, add new books, delete books from the library, purchase books, and display an invoice after the purchase.
- After a purchase, the number of book copies should be updated.

### Instructions:
- The project must be fully submitted through GitHub.
- The project should include a README.md file with instructions on how to run and test the project.

### Evaluation:
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Completion: The project will be assessed based on how well it meets the requirements.
- Quality: The project will be evaluated based on its quality, including coding style, organization, and ease of maintenance.
- Use of programming concepts such as class, abstract, function, and others.
- Testing: The project will be assessed based on the extent of its test coverage for features.

### Time Frame:
The project should be completed within 3 days.

### Proposed Tasks:
1. Project Structure: Create a new Dart project and organize its structure appropriately.
2. User Interface: Develop a simple CLI user interface that allows users to query books and view the number of available copies.
3. Add New Book: Provide a method to add a new book to the library while updating the number of book copies.
4. Delete Book: Provide a method to delete a book from the library and update the book count.
5. Purchase: Implement the purchase process and decrease the number of book copies according to the books purchased.
6. Invoice: Display a detailed invoice after the purchase.
7. Editing Capability: Add the ability to modify book data, such as title, author, and price.

You can implement the proposed tasks above and expand them as needed. It is preferred to use Dart's programming concepts and ensure clean and organized code.

Good luck with the project, and feel free to ask any additional questions if needed!
