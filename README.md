# Project #1 - Library Project using Dart

## Congratulations!
Congratulations on reaching the capstone project phase of the course! Over the next several weeks, you will be working on a series of four capstone projects that will allow you to apply your knowledge and skills to build real-world applications. Each capstone project will serve as a demonstration of your proficiency in Flutter Development and will provide an opportunity to refine your skills with every iteration. 

## Description

The "Library Project using Dart" is a software application developed to manage a library's book inventory and facilitate user interactions through a Command Line Interface (CLI). The project is implemented in the Dart programming language, providing a user-friendly and efficient experience for both library staff and patrons.

## Rules & Guidelines

1. **Individual Work:** Each student is expected to work individually on their exam. Collaboration is not allowed, and each student should submit their unique work.
2. **Version Control (Git):**
   - Create a Fork from the exam’s GitHub repository.
   - Create a new branch with your name, i.e., Nawaf-Alshawan.
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages to show your progress.
   - Finally, create a Pull Request to the exam’s original repository containing your solution.
3. **Academic Integrity:** Do not copy or reuse code from previous modules or external sources. The exam is a showcase of your learning progress.
4. **Learning References:** You may refer to course materials and code examples as learning references, but implement your solutions independently.
5. **Instructor Support:** The instructor will be available for general questions and guidance throughout the exam.

## Schedule & Deadlines

- **Project Start Date:** 27/7/2023 - 3:00 PM
- **Project Submission Deadline:** 30/7/2023 – 11:59 PM

## Minimum Requirements

Your task is to create a Library Project using Dart language. The project should have a CLI (Command Line Interface) that allows users to query books, view the number of available copies, add new books, delete books from the library, purchase books, and display an invoice after the purchase. After purchase, the number of book copies should be updated. 

- **Project Structure:** Create a new Dart project and organize its structure appropriately. 
- **Query Books:** Develop a simple CLI user interface that allows users to query books and view the number of available copies. 
- **Add New Book:** Provide a method to add a new book to the library while updating the number of book copies. 
- **Delete Book:** Provide a method to delete a book from the library and update the book count. 
- **Purchase:** Implement the purchase process and decrease the number of book copies according to the books purchased. 
- **Invoice:** Display a detailed invoice after the purchase. 
- **Editing Capability:** Add the ability to modify book data, such as title, author, and price. 

## Ideas for Extra Credit

1. **Display all Book Categories:** Provide a method to display a list of all book categories in the library, and when selecting a category return a list of all books in this category.
2.  **Count the number of purchased books:** Provide a method to count the number of all purchased books from the library. 

## Delivery Requirements

- The project should be written in Dart language.
- The project must be fully submitted through GitHub.
- The project should include a README.md file with instructions on how to run and test the project.

## Evaluation:

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Completion: The project will be assessed based on how well it meets the requirements.
- Quality: The project will be evaluated based on its quality, including coding style, organization, and ease of maintenance.
- Use of programming concepts such as class, abstract, function, and others.
